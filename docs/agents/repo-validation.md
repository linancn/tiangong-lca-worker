## Default Baseline

Unless the change is doc-only repo-maintenance work, the default baseline is:

```bash
make check
cargo clippy -p solver-worker --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

Treat the last two commands as non-negotiable hard gates after code changes.

The local `pre-push` hook runs the docpact gate first and then runs `make check`. The GitHub `ci` workflow is manual-dispatch only, so ordinary branch pushes do not spend Actions minutes on standalone tests.

## Validation Matrix

| Change type | Minimum local proof | Additional proof when risk is higher | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/**` solver or worker code | `make check`; hard Clippy gate; hard format gate | run the narrow manual script that matches the touched area, such as snapshot build, full compute debug, or BW25 validation | Record which job family or worker path was exercised. |
| solver `worker_jobs` queue backend | `cargo test -p solver-worker worker_jobs`; `cargo test -p solver-worker maps_worker_jobs`; `cargo check -p solver-worker`; hard Clippy gate; hard format gate | when DB/S3 env is available, enqueue one safe `worker_queue=solver` job and run `solver-worker --queue-backend worker-jobs --mode worker` to verify claim/heartbeat/result projection | Keep `docs/lca-api-contract.md` and `docs/edge-function-integration.md` aligned with job kind, payload schema, and legacy `lca_jobs` compatibility expectations. |
| snapshot-builder or provider-matching behavior | baseline gates plus `./scripts/build_snapshot_from_ilcd.sh` when safe | run provider-link diagnostics export helpers when the task changes matching logic | Snapshot and provider diagnostics often need task-specific proof. |
| matrix-readiness / provider-closure gate | `cargo test -p solver-worker readiness`; `cargo check -p solver-worker --bin matrix_readiness`; hard Clippy gate for the touched binary/module | run `snapshot_builder` or `matrix_readiness --input <fixture> --out <report>` against the closest available target snapshot artifact | Keep `docs/matrix-readiness-report-contract.md` aligned with blocker/finding code, policy, and next_action changes. Use `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig` on local Homebrew setups so SuiteSparse/UMFPACK link metadata is discoverable. |
| review-submit fast gate | `cargo test -p solver-worker review_submit_gate`; `cargo check -p solver-worker --bin review_submit_gate`; for DB runner or `worker_jobs` changes also run `cargo test -p solver-worker worker_jobs`, `cargo test -p solver-worker review_submit_gate_runner`, and `cargo check -p solver-worker --bin review_submit_gate_runner`; hard Clippy gate for the touched binary/module | run `review_submit_gate --input <fixture> --out <report> --fail-on-blocked` against a representative dataset revision artifact; for live DB runner changes, run `review_submit_gate_runner --once` or `review_submit_gate_runner --worker-jobs --once` against a safe queued gate run when service-role DB and S3 artifact env are available | Keep `docs/review-submit-fast-gate-contract.md` aligned with blocker codes, policy defaults, targeted probe behavior, and DB result-recorder semantics. |
| maintenance worker_jobs / GC orchestration | `cargo check -p solver-worker --bin maintenance_worker`; `cargo check -p solver-worker --bin maintenance_enqueue`; `cargo test -p solver-worker --bin maintenance_worker`; `cargo test -p solver-worker --bin maintenance_enqueue`; run the touched GC filter such as `cargo test -p solver-worker snapshot_gc`, `cargo test -p solver-worker result_gc`, or `cargo test -p solver-worker package_gc`; hard Clippy gate for all targets | run a safe dry-run `lca.snapshot_gc`, `lca.result_gc`, or `tidas.package_artifact_gc` worker job in dev when DB and storage env are available | Keep `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md`, `README.md`, deployment units, and the package/LCA retention docs aligned with job kind, payload, summary, and destructive-execute safety semantics. |
| package worker import or export flows | baseline gates | run the closest safe package-flow helper or record why live package proof is deferred | Package-job semantics are runtime-sensitive and may depend on storage or DB state. |
| package `worker_jobs` queue backend | `cargo test -p solver-worker --bin package_worker`; `cargo test -p solver-worker package_worker`; `cargo check -p solver-worker --bin package_worker`; hard Clippy gate; hard format gate | when DB/S3 env is available, enqueue one safe `worker_queue=package` job and run `package_worker --package-queue-backend worker-jobs` to verify claim/heartbeat/result projection | Keep `docs/tidas-package-contract.md` aligned with job kind, payload schema, continuation behavior, artifact projection, and legacy `lca_package_jobs` compatibility expectations. |
| runtime SQL expectation docs or local migration helpers | baseline gates plus `./scripts/validate_additive_migration.sh` when the task touches migration expectations | record separately when durable schema proof is required in `database-engine` | Local migration files here are not the workspace-wide source of truth. |
| manual debug, parity, or target-validation scripts | run the touched script with safe args or `--help` when available, plus baseline gates if code changed nearby | `./scripts/run_full_compute_debug.sh`, `./scripts/run_bw25_validation.sh`, or `./scripts/validate_lcia_targets.sh` as applicable | `bw25-validator` is manual-only and out-of-band. |
| repo docs, `.env.example`, or docpact config only | `scripts/docpact validate-config --root . --strict`; `scripts/docpact lint --root . --worktree --mode enforce` | perform route checks for affected intent surfaces such as `solver-runtime`, `package-worker`, or `runtime-sql-boundary` | Refresh review metadata even when prose-only docs change. Keep `.env.example` secret-free. |

## Minimum PR Note Quality

A good PR note for this repo should say:

1. which baseline gates ran
2. which job family, script, or manual parity helper was exercised
3. whether any required database-engine or edge-functions proof lives elsewhere

## Docpact Governance Notes

The repo's machine-readable governance source is `.docpact/config.yaml`.

That means:

- governed-doc rules, routing intents, ownership boundaries, and freshness live in `.docpact/config.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/ai-doc-lint.yml` is manual-dispatch fallback and should delegate to the same local docpact gate
- retained explanatory docs stay in `AGENTS.md`, this file, `repo-architecture.md`, `README.md`, and the narrow runtime-facing contract docs under `docs/*.md`

Do not recreate deleted `ai/*` files under a new name. Keep deterministic facts in config and explanatory material in retained source docs.

## Local Docpact Push Gate

Install the versioned local hook once per checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The `pre-push` hook runs `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`, which delegates CLI lookup to `scripts/docpact` and performs strict config validation plus enforced lint before the push leaves the machine. It then runs `make check` as the local test gate. The wrapper checks `DOCPACT_BIN`, Cargo install locations, Homebrew install locations, and then `PATH`, so local agent shells should not fail only because bare `docpact` is unavailable. The default comparison base is `origin/main`. Override it for unusual stacks with `DOCPACT_BASE_REF=<ref>` or `scripts/docpact-gate.sh --base <ref>`. The gate writes its detailed report to a temporary file so normal pushes do not create `.docpact/runs/` artifacts.
