## Repo Shape

This repo is a Rust workspace with three core layers:

- `crates/suitesparse-ffi`
- `crates/solver-core`
- `crates/solver-worker`

The runtime solves sparse systems asynchronously and keeps heavy compute out of the API layer.

## Core Solver Invariants

Keep these constraints in mind before editing `crates/solver-core/**` or worker solve flows:

- The runtime solves the sparse system `Mx = b` with `M = I - A`; preserve that modeling contract when reshaping matrix-build code.
- Do not introduce explicit matrix inversion for solve paths. Reuse factorization or sparse-solve flows instead.
- Heavy recomputation belongs in async worker jobs, not inline request handlers or API-edge adapters.
- If a change affects factorization reuse, provider matching, or snapshot payload shape, review worker and persistence paths together.

## Current Runtime Families

### Solve and queue jobs

The worker currently covers families such as:

- `prepare_factorization`
- `solve_one`
- `solve_batch`
- `solve_all_unit`
- `invalidate_factorization`
- `rebuild_factorization`
- `analyze_contribution_path`
- `build_snapshot`

These flows belong to the worker runtime, not to the API repo.

The main solver worker has two queue backends. The default `SOLVER_QUEUE_BACKEND=worker-jobs` path claims `public.worker_jobs` rows from `worker_queue=solver`, maps `job_kind=lca.*` payloads back to the same internal `JobPayload` variants, heartbeats `phase/progress`, records terminal results through `worker_record_job_result`, and links retained `lca_jobs` / `lca_results` / cache rows back to the canonical `worker_jobs` id. The `SOLVER_QUEUE_BACKEND=pgmq` path is legacy compatibility/debug only, consumes `pgmq` messages from `PGMQ_QUEUE`, and requires the explicit `ALLOW_LEGACY_JOB_TABLE_BACKEND=true` / `--allow-legacy-job-table-backend` guard.

### Snapshot builder and provider matching

The snapshot builder path owns sparse payload generation, provider matching, and snapshot artifact metadata.
The modeling basis for implicit regional supply mix, exchange-location supply-region anchors, and annual-volume provider shares lives in `docs/implicit-regional-supply-mix-modeling.md` and `docs/implicit-regional-supply-mix-modeling.en.md`.

`crates/solver-worker/src/readiness.rs` owns the worker-side verification gate for automated data production. It turns snapshot coverage, sparse payloads, and optional compiled provider decisions into a machine-readable matrix-readiness report. Foundry and CLI callers should consume that report instead of reimplementing provider closure, singular-risk, LCIA, or factorization checks outside the worker. The stable report schema, blocker/finding codes, and next-action semantics live in `docs/matrix-readiness-report-contract.md`.

`crates/solver-worker/src/review_submit_gate.rs` owns the worker-side fast gate for dataset revision review submission. It layers revision freshness, process/exchange scans, provider evidence, sparse structural checks, and targeted RHS probes into a binary `passed` / `blocked` report without full matrix inversion or full `solve_all_unit`.

`crates/solver-worker/src/review_submit_gate_runner.rs`, `crates/solver-worker/src/worker_jobs.rs`, and `crates/solver-worker/src/bin/review_submit_gate_runner.rs` are the DB runtime bridge for that gate. The legacy mode claims persisted `dataset_review_submit_gate_runs`; the `--worker-jobs` mode claims child `review_submit.gate` jobs from `public.worker_jobs`. Both modes build a no-LCIA review-submit baseline plus draft overlay snapshot for the submitted process revision, compute the `json_ordered` checksum, execute `review_submit_gate`, and record the result through the database RPC. The root `review_submit.submit` job is created and advanced by the DB/Edge coordinator contract; worker only executes the numeric gate child job.

### Maintenance worker

`crates/solver-worker/src/bin/maintenance_enqueue.rs` is the operator/timer entrypoint that enqueues worker maintenance jobs through `public.worker_enqueue_job`. `crates/solver-worker/src/bin/maintenance_worker.rs` is the `worker_jobs` consumer for maintenance work that should be observable through the shared job lifecycle. It claims `worker_queue=maintenance` and dispatches these job kinds:

- `lca.snapshot_gc`
- `lca.result_gc`
- `tidas.package_artifact_gc`

The maintenance worker is intentionally a thin orchestrator over the existing `snapshot_gc`, `result_gc`, and `package_gc` binaries. Those binaries keep their deletion safety rules, object-first metadata updates, active snapshot/package protections, and PostgreSQL advisory locks. The `worker_jobs` layer records dry-run/execute intent, phase/heartbeat, exit status, stdout/stderr tails, parsed `[summary]` metrics, and an operator-only `maintenance_gc_report` artifact metadata row for operator visibility.

### Package worker

The package worker handles:

- `export_package`
- `import_package`

It also owns package-job artifacts and diagnostics. The default `PACKAGE_QUEUE_BACKEND=worker-jobs` path claims `public.worker_jobs` rows from `worker_queue=package`, maps `job_kind=tidas.export_package|tidas.import_package` into the same `PackageJobPayload` variants, heartbeats package progress, records terminal `worker_jobs` results, and links retained `lca_package_jobs` / artifacts / request-cache rows back to the canonical `worker_jobs` id. The `PACKAGE_QUEUE_BACKEND=pgmq` path is legacy compatibility/debug only, consumes `pgmq` messages from `lca_package_jobs`, and requires the explicit `ALLOW_LEGACY_JOB_TABLE_BACKEND=true` / `--allow-legacy-job-table-backend` guard.

### Result persistence

Result artifacts are persisted through the worker and supporting runtime storage flows instead of inlining heavy compute payloads into the API layer.

## Operational Baseline

- Solve result persistence is S3-only; treat `lca_results` as artifact metadata plus diagnostics, not as an inline result store.
- The worker uses a main DB pool plus an optional queue-only DB pool. The main pool is configured through `DATABASE_URL` / `CONN`, `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `DB_MIN_CONNECTIONS`, and `DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; it should remain on a session/direct connection or session pooler when compute paths use SQLx bound queries. The queue-only pool is configured through `QUEUE_DATABASE_URL` / `QUEUE_CONN`, `QUEUE_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `QUEUE_DB_MIN_CONNECTIONS`, and `QUEUE_DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; if no queue URL is set it reuses the main pool.
- `WORKER_ID`, `WORKER_JOBS_CLAIM_LIMIT`, and `WORKER_JOBS_LEASE_SECONDS` control solver `worker_jobs` claim diagnostics, batch size, and lease renewal. Keep the lease longer than a normal solve/snapshot heartbeat interval and use `BUILD_SNAPSHOT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` for actual snapshot build throttling.
- `build_snapshot` is globally throttled with a PostgreSQL transaction-level advisory lock (`BUILD_SNAPSHOT_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, default `1`) across worker instances; keep `WORKER_VT_SECONDS` larger than the worst-case lock wait plus build time.
- Runtime SQLx queries use non-persistent prepared statements so the worker does not reuse named prepared statements across PostgreSQL session reuse boundaries. High-frequency pgmq polling and archive operations use the queue-only pool plus `raw_sql` with validated queue-name literals so they can run through the simple query protocol on Supabase's 6543 transaction pooler without moving compute/package/snapshot queries onto that pooler.
- Queue enqueue and protected writes stay on service-side runtime paths guarded by existing RLS and `service_role` boundaries.
- Worker and snapshot paths require DB connectivity plus the required S3 env set before runtime validation is meaningful.

## Runtime SQL Boundary

This repo still documents and depends on runtime SQL expectations, but durable schema governance belongs in `database-engine`.

Use this rule:

- runtime compute truth here
- durable schema, migration, RPC, and policy truth there

## Cross-Repo Boundaries

- `edge-functions` owns request normalization, auth, enqueue, and polling API behavior
- `database-engine` owns durable schema governance
- `lca-workspace` owns root delivery completion after a child PR merges

## Common Misreads

- API behavior does not belong in the solver repo
- local migrations here are not the workspace-wide schema source of truth
- a merged child PR does not finish workspace delivery

## Local Docpact Push Gate

This repository has a versioned local `pre-push` hook under `.githooks/pre-push` that delegates to `scripts/docpact-gate.sh` and then runs `make check`. The gate resolves the CLI through `scripts/docpact`, so local agent shells do not need bare `docpact` on `PATH`. The hook is the local guard for docpact config validation, enforced doc-governance linting, and worker runtime tests; the GitHub `ci` workflow is manual-dispatch only.
